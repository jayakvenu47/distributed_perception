# Multi-Robot Target Tracking Based on Kalman Filters and Multilateration
## Overview
This project implements a multi-robot target tracking system using Kalman Filters and Multilateration. The system is designed to simulate a scenario where multiple robots collaboratively track a moving target. The project compares the performance of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and Multilateration in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Features
- **Multi-robot coordination for target tracking
- **Comparison of EKF, UKF, and Multilateration
- **Data fusion from multiple sensors (IMU, GPS)
- **Dynamic and static target tracking scenarios
- **Simulation environment for testing and validation
