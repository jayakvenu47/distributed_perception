# Multi-Robot Target Tracking Based on Kalman Filters and Multilateration
## Overview
This project implements a multi-robot target tracking system using Kalman Filters and Multilateration. The system is designed to simulate a scenario where multiple robots collaboratively track a moving target. The project compares the performance of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and Multilateration in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Features
- Multi-robot coordination for target tracking
- Comparison of EKF, UKF, and Multilateration
- Data fusion from multiple sensors (IMU, GPS)
- Dynamic and static target tracking scenarios
- Simulation environment for testing and validation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
```
    git clone https://github.com/jayakvenu/distributed_perception.git'
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
    git clone https://github.com/jayakvenu/distributed_perception.git'
```

## Usage
### To run the simulation, simply execute the corresponding MATLAB files:

1. For dynamic tracking, run dynamic_tracking.m.
2. For static tracking, run static_tracking_l.m.
